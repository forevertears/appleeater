 ^  I'm very paranoid about dnis/dnius so if you have it written but does not mind talking to someone,me,Specifically,talk to me first because i don't want to screw things up...(won't start a conversation first) it's most likely that I'll be kinda nervous at first bc i might think i did something wrong or that I'm bothering you.. i really respect rules even more when it's about ppl,but that doesn't mean you can't interact with me too,of course · · ·* ^

                     ⚰️

 ^ *I rlly enjoy being close to anyone or showing affection both irl and online plus I'm really clingy n affectionate n other stuff...i open up easily and quickly get intimate,like,REAL quick...(in the sec i meet you, basically... depending if you're an introvert, I'm not too social with quiet,dry or something ppl,so I try to act almost like them to match their energy so they can feel more comfortable,but if it's the opposite Ppl, I'll be myself.i just feel awkward) and I've been wanting someone like this too...erm...yeah,if you don't like ppl like me js block me, I'm HEAVILY insecure too.* ^
 
***i have undiagnosed adhd, anxiety and depression.***
 
i have some psychopathic traits (it's an espectrum,i'm not a psychopath nor a diagnosed one) but you could say i'm 'one of those' just in a more lower intencity level. (doesnt feel guilt,masks emotions,did bad stuff in the past w animals (i regret it,i was a child) and family,doesnt understand others feelings,lack of empathy,doesnt feel anything in a shocking situation or ppl dying,manipulates others for own gain,shoplifting,etc.) i relate to all of those. yes as i said,not a fully psycho;i still have some emotions and feelings,i care for others and love some,have traumas and so on..
